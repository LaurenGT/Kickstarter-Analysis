## Conclusions we can draw

One conclusion that can be drawn from this Kickstarter campaign data is that the United States is the country with the highest utilization of this specific crowdfunding service, however they are not the most successful in proportion to their total number of campaigns. 75% Of all the campaigns in the data set are based in the United States with their success rate sitting at 54%. Great Britain, the second highest user, has a success rate of 61% proportionate to their total number of campaigns which makes up 15% of all the campaigns in the data set. 

A second conclusion that can be drawn from this data is that plays are the most successful campaign subcategory on Kickstarter. 32% Of all the successful campaigns are sub-categorized as plays with the next highest success rate being only 12%.  

A third conclusion to draw from this data is that the month of May has the highest amount of success both in raw numbers as well as proportionately to the total number of successes, however success rates show an overall decline from January through December.

## Limitations of the data

Something this data set does not show is what type of promoting is associated with each campaign. By looking at this data set, we are unable to determine how hands on or involved the campaign creators were. Also not included in the data is individual contribution amounts by backers. In campaigns with more than one backer, we are unable to use anything value other than total or average contributions. A third limitation of this data set is a lack of cancellation reasons. Being able to understand campaigns that met or exceeded their funding goals or campaigns that received no backers or funding but ultimately ended up cancelled could shed light on trends within this state. One last limitation is the different currencies included in the data set not allowing for a one to one comparison of campaigns from different companies.

## Alternate charts options

In addition to the tables and graphs presented in this report, this data could be represented in other potentially useful ways to identify trends in Kickstarter campaigns. It could be reviewed as state versus the goal to identify any potential “sweet spots” for a funding goal. Analysing staff picks and spotlight campaigns as they correlate to state, percent funded and categories or subcategories could provide new insight. Adding an additional calculation to show the duration of a campaign from creation to ending would allow for a comparison of duration to state, category or subcategory or percent funded to review the average duration of campaigns and if this has any impact on the final outcome of the campaign.

## Statistical Analysis

There is more variability with successful campaigns than with failed campaigns. This is a logical outcome considering the difference in the maximum number of backers between successful and failed campaigns. The is a much larger range in the amount of backers in the successful campaigns than in the failed campaigns. 

In the case of both the successful and failed campaigns, using the median to summarize the data is more meaningful. The data is skewed by a large number of outliers in both scenarios as well as some of these outliers falling far outside of the interquartile range.
